# JACK
## Description
This is an example of code for working with a file test in different ways. It clearly demonstrates the difference in execution speed between OOP, FP, and IP.

This example helps to understand which method takes less time than the others (with other types of data and cases, the results may be completely different).

Additionally, the program has different ways to count words:
- `Count` - use type `collections.Counter`;
- `CountDefaultdict` - use type `collections.defaultdict`;
- `CountDict` - use type `dict`;
- `CountList` - use type `list`.

I used Count, in my opinion it is faster and the code looks clean.

## How to start
To run the program, go to `app.py` and run it.

Then you will see in the console the difference between the execution time of different programming methods.
